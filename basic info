ll is a linear data structure made up with collection of nodes.
why LL!!!--array cant be changed on runtime.Vector also is not optimal.
           LL is dynamic DS.no memory wastage
           To insert or delete, we dont need to shift nodes unlike array.
           Data is stored in heap.
types of LL--> 1.singly LL
               2.doubly LL
               3.circular LL
