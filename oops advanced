encapsulation--wrapping up data members and functions inside single entity or class
fully encapsulated class--all data members are marked private for that class
advantages of encapsulation--information-hiding / data-hiding / security aspect stonks / we can make class read-only / help in unit testing

inheritance--properties of one class is inherited to another class.
                                    class ParentClassName{
                                    };
                                    class subclassName: accessmodifier ParentClassName{
                                    };
protected is similar to private but it can also be used in childClass unlike private.
parentclass is also called as super class or base class.
